## Hey Chris.  I built a website for you!

I was doing some domain name searching for work, and for some reason you popped into my head, so i searched for your name and found https://ChrisSalerno.net.  I bought the domain; you now own ChrisSalerno.net.  Pretty cool, right?

I've always thought that you would have *_really_* enjoyed learning how to program.  Most people think it involves some sort of super complicated math, but it's really just a bunch of conditional logic and basic oeprations.  You'd like it, I'm positive.  Plus, who doesn't want the ability to make computers do anything they want?!  It's like a super power.

So, if you ever decide that you want to spend some time and poke around, you now have a fantastic project to start with (this was one of my first projects too).  You can also choose to ignore this and to absolutely nothing with it, that's totally fine too.  No hurt feelings on this side.

Anyways - here ya go!  The rest of the text here is instructional stuff for customizing your page.

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/gta-productions/chrissalerno.net/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/gta-productions/chrissalerno.net/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
